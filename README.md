# Fellowship_Acceptance - A Real Business Case Study
Data analysis and modeling to help understand consumers and finally decide whether or not a candidate should be accepted as a fellow to the organization. I will refer to this organization as "XYZ". 

# Introduction: 

XYZ is an online program which provides mentorship, career training and workshps, etc. to help job seekers land their dream job in tech. They admit candidates (fellows) into their program every two weeks into one of the following tracks / fields:

1: Software Engineering
2: Data 
3: Product
4: Design
5: Marketing

While the program itself is free to join after completing a set of admission and interview stages, the fellows will have to sign an income share agreement after the first 2-week trial period. XYZ invests a lot in hiring the best possible mentors across the different industries, resources to provide the best service in helping a candidate apply and prepare for interviews across all stages. This investment is extremely expensive and for the business to be successful, XYZ should also be picking the best candidates who ensure a return on investment once they get placed at a company. Being able to predict if a candidate will be placed, and how long it will take is extremely crucial for the organization to run a stable business. The main goal of my analysis and modeling will revolve around the same.
