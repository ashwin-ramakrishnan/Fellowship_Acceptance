# Fellowship_Acceptance - A Real Business Case Study
Data analysis and modeling to help understand consumers and finally decide whether or not a candidate should be accepted as a fellow to the organization. I will refer to this organization as "XYZ". 

# Introduction: 
XYZ is an online program that provides 1-on-1 mentorship, training, and advice to help job seekers get the best possible jobs in tech. Every two weeks, XYZ welcomes a new cohort of fellows. If a candidate is interested in joining the program and successfully passes all stages of the admission process, they receive an offer to join XYZ and become a fellow. The first 2 weeks in the program are called a free trial period and a fellow can withdraw within this free trial period without any penalty. After 2 weeks, a fellow needs to sign an ISA (Income Share Agreement) with XYZ if they want to stay in the program. The entire program lasts a year, including 8 weeks of the core curriculum. If a fellow couldn’t find a job within a year after joining XYZ, his/her contract is terminated. However, there might be some exceptions. For instance, if someone was on a break, we may extend their contract for the period of the break. 

On average, for fellows who stay with XYZ after their free trial period, it takes about 4 months to receive a final job offer. However, there is a lot of variation in fellows’ outcomes. Being able to predict how fast every single fellow is going to find a job is crucial for XYZ's business. 
 
The main goal of my analysis is to derive insights around if a fellow will ultimately be placed at a company and how long until a placement can be expected.
